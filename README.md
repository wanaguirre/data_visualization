In this repository I will present some tools to use to develop more understandable graphs.

## Layering

## Faceting
Faceting can be used to show more data, provide context, and make a visualization easier to undersatand.

### 1.
Based on the same concept as in one of the previous exercise (the cars one), separate the results according to the type of car model involved.
